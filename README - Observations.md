3 Observable Trends - Weather Data

1. The latitude coordinate of a location has a very strong correlation to what the maximum temperature will be.
2. The closer to the equator (0 latitude) the higher the maximum temperature of any given location will be.
3. The latitudinal location of a city does not have much much of a relationship with any given weather indicator other than maximum temperature.
